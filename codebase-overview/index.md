# Tutorial: monopoly-clone-og

This project is a digital clone of the classic **Monopoly** board game.
Players *roll dice*, move around the board, buy and manage *properties*, pay rent, and interact with Chance/Community Chest cards.
The game features a visual interface built with *HTML/CSS* and uses *JavaScript* to handle the game's rules, player turns, property management, building houses, and a **trading system** between players.
The objective is typically to become the wealthiest player or bankrupt opponents, depending on the chosen game mode (e.g., Last Man Standing or Timed).
